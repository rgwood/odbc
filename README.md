# odbc
Demo implementations of the [Postgres Wire Protocol](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/protocol.html).

By implementing the Wire Protocol in a backend, any database driver compatible with Postgres can be used to access that backend. That means it is possible to access such a backend through the [Postgres ODBC](https://odbc.postgresql.org/) or [Postgres JDBC](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/) drivers.
